Spam Mail Detection is a machine learning project that classifies emails as spam or ham using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It processes text data, extracts features with TF-IDF, and trains models like Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression to accurately detect and filter spam messages.
